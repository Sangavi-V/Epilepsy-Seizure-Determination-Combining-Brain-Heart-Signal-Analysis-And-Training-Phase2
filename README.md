# Epilepsy-Seizure-Determination-Combining-Brain-Heart-Signal-Analysis-And-Training-Phase2
# Abstract.
Epilepsy affects over 50 million people globally. Precise detection of seizure events is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment. Electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used for investigating seizure activity in the brain. However, EEG alone has limitations in capturing subtle seizure onset patterns. Recent evi-dence indicates heart signals also change during seizures due to brain-heart inter-actions. This paper proposes a novel methodology for epilepsy seizure determi-nation by integrating analysis of EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using machine learning techniques. The study collates EEG and ECG datasets from epilepsy patients. Rigorous preprocessing is applied and the integrated timeseries used to train supervised classification models including Feedforward Neural Net-work, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM and Decision Tree. Results demonstrate that combining EEG and ECG data enables significantly more accurate seizure detection compared to EEG alone. The integrated brain-heart signal analysis ap-proach holds strong promise for improving automated seizure determination sys-tems. This could lead to more effective diagnosis and timely treatment for pa-tients.
